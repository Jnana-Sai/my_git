I would describe myself as a flexible, energetic, fast learner, someone who seeks new challenges and try to think out-of-the-box to solve a problem.
Why i would like to contribute to open source:
I believe it is a good platform to gain experiene working in real projects and build up cnfidence. I can also get chance to meet other developers and learn from them and buil myself as a good developer.
